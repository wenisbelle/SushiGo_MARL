"""
Sushi Go! — PettingZoo Parallel environment for multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Sushi Go is a card-drafting game. Over 3 rounds, all players SIMULTANEOUSLY pick one
card from their hand, then pass the rest of the hand to the next player. After each
round, dishes are scored; pudding is scored once at the end of the game.

Because every player moves at the same time, this is modelled with the PettingZoo
Parallel API (the natural fit for simultaneous-move games). Convert to the AEC
paradigm with `pettingzoo.utils.parallel_to_aec` if your training stack needs it.


OBSERVATION DESIGN

Each agent's observation is a structured DictSpace plus two masks. The state
features are built ego-centrically (from that agent's seat) and are kept as named
arrays so transformer/encoder models can consume sequential parts directly.
`flatten_observation()` converts the same fields back to the legacy deterministic
flat order for simple MLP baselines.

  1. current_hand        : counts of each of the 12 card types in the hand the
                           agent is holding RIGHT NOW (the hand it drafts from).

  2. hand_history        : a fixed-length sequence of the last `history_len` hands the
                           agent has seen this round, most-recent-first. Each
                           remembered hand is a 12-vector of card-type counts,
                           recorded AS THE AGENT RECEIVED IT (before it drafted).
                           This is imperfect information: slot k holds the hand
                           seen k turns ago, and since then k other players have
                           drafted from it, so that memory is k drafts STALE.
                           `history_len` defaults to `max_n_players - 1` so the
                           shape is stable even when the active player count is
                           sampled on reset. Missing slots are filled with -1.0,
                           the padding sentinel used by the encoder.

  3. own_tableau         : the agent's own cards on the table — 12 type counts
                           plus [unused_wasabi, pudding_total].

  4. opponent_tableaus   : a fixed-length sequence of opponent tableaus (public
                           info in Sushi Go), ordered by seat offset, each as 12
                           counts plus [unused_wasabi, pudding_total]. When fewer
                           than `max_n_players` seats are active, unavailable
                           opponent slots are filled with -1.0. Disable with
                           `include_opponent_tableaus=False`.

  5. cards_played        : normalized counts of each of the 12 card types
                           discarded/played by all players so far this round.

  + game_scalars         : [round_index / 3, cards_in_hand / hand_size].

  + action_mask          : legal card-type actions for this specific seat.

  + player_mask          : boolean scalar for this dense slot. It is True for
                           active seats and False for inactive padded seats.
                           After TorchRL groups the PettingZoo agents, these
                           scalars form the dense player-axis mask.

The observation specs depend on `max_n_players` and `history_len`, not the
sampled active count. This lets replay buffers and TorchRL collectors batch games
with different active player counts in the same static tensor shapes.


ACTION DESIGN
Discrete(12): choose which CARD TYPE to draft this turn. Working in card-type
space (rather than hand-position space) gives a fixed, semantically meaningful
action space and a trivial action mask (`mask[t] = 1` iff a card of type t is in
the current hand). Invalid actions are gracefully redirected to a legal card.


CHOPSTICKS
Chopsticks are kept in the deck as an authentic collectible card, but the
"swap chopsticks back to draft 2 cards in one turn" mechanic is OMITTED in this
version so the action stays a single Discrete. To add it, turn the action into a
MultiDiscrete([12, 13]) where the second component is 0 (no chopsticks) or
1..12 (also draft that type, returning a chopsticks token to the hand).
