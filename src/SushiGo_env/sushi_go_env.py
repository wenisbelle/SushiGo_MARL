"""
Sushi Go! — PettingZoo Parallel environment for multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Sushi Go is a card-drafting game. Over 3 rounds, all players SIMULTANEOUSLY pick one
card from their hand, then pass the rest of the hand to the next player. After each
round, dishes are scored; pudding is scored once at the end of the game.

Because every player moves at the same time, this is modelled with the PettingZoo
Parallel API (the natural fit for simultaneous-move games). Convert to the AEC
paradigm with `pettingzoo.utils.parallel_to_aec` if your training stack needs it.


OBSERVATION DESIGN

Each agent's observation is a flat float vector with four sections, plus an
`action_mask`. The observation is built ego-centrically (from that agent's seat).

  1. current_hand        : counts of each of the 12 card types in the hand the
                           agent is holding RIGHT NOW (the hand it drafts from).

  2. hand_history        : a rolling memory of the last `history_len` hands the
                           agent has seen this round, most-recent-first. Each
                           remembered hand is a 12-vector of card-type counts,
                           recorded AS THE AGENT RECEIVED IT (before it drafted).
                           This is imperfect information: slot k holds the hand
                           seen k turns ago, and since then k other players have
                           drafted from it, so that memory is k drafts STALE.
                           `history_len` defaults to `n_players - 1`, i.e. exactly
                           one lap of the table — after that the hand would have
                           come all the way back around and the memory is
                           completely outdated, so it drops out of the buffer.
                           Slots are zero-filled at the start of each round before
                           the buffer has filled.

  3. own_tableau         : the agent's own cards on the table — 12 type counts
                           plus [unused_wasabi, pudding_total].

  4. opponent_tableaus   : every opponent's cards on the table (public info in
                           Sushi Go), ordered by seat offset, each as 12 counts
                           plus [unused_wasabi, pudding_total]. Disable with
                           `include_opponent_tableaus=False`.

   5. cards_played    : counts of each of the 12 card types descarted by all
                            players so far this round 

  + game_scalars         : [round_index / 3, cards_in_hand / hand_size].

The observation size depends on `n_players` and `history_len` (a fresh env is
created per player count for training). `split_observation()` decodes a raw
vector back into named sections for debugging.


ACTION DESIGN
Discrete(12): choose which CARD TYPE to draft this turn. Working in card-type
space (rather than hand-position space) gives a fixed, semantically meaningful
action space and a trivial action mask (`mask[t] = 1` iff a card of type t is in
the current hand). Invalid actions are gracefully redirected to a legal card.


CHOPSTICKS
Chopsticks are kept in the deck as an authentic collectible card, but the
"swap chopsticks back to draft 2 cards in one turn" mechanic is OMITTED in this
version so the action stays a single Discrete. To add it, turn the action into a
MultiDiscrete([12, 13]) where the second component is 0 (no chopsticks) or
1..12 (also draft that type, returning a chopsticks token to the hand).
